# 🏦 Vault DApp — Solana Learning Project

A **learning-focused Solana Vault DApp** built with **Anchor, Rust, Next.js, and Wallet Adapter**.  
This project demonstrates how to design, deploy, and interact with a secure SOL vault using real-world Solana development patterns.

The goal is simple but powerful:  
**learn Solana by building something real**.

## 🧠 What This Project Teaches

This project is designed for developers who want **hands-on Solana experience**, not just theory.

You will learn:
- How Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) work
- How SOL transfers happen inside programs
- Vault-style account ownership patterns
- Anchor-based program architecture
- Wallet integration using Solana Wallet Adapter
- End-to-end flow: frontend → program → chain
